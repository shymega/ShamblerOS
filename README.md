# shyOS

shyOS is an purely experimental fully-fledged operating system.

shyOS takes from decades of computer science research, learns from the
best, and crafts it into the (next? oh man what a bombshell) operating
system that might, or might not work. Who knows?

shyOS is _not_ like Linux, which is merely a monolithic kernel with
dynamically-loadable modules.
